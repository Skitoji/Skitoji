# Hey there 👋

I’m **Samuel**, a **Design Hipermedia student** based in **Colombia 🇨🇴**. I’m currently learning programming as a **hobby**, mixing design and code to build clear, organized, and visually pleasing projects.

I enjoy working on small projects and experiments where I can practice, learn, and improve step by step. This GitHub is my personal space to document that journey.
